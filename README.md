# Unity Simple Systems & Functions

üåè English | [CN ‰∏≠Êñá](README.CN.md)

A collection of simple, reusable systems and functions for Unity projects. This repository contains ready-to-use modules that can help streamline your Unity game development.

## Available Systems


### 1. [SaveSettingsSystem][https://github.com/whatevertogo/Unity-SaveSystem]

#### For the future i will add 2 more to make the systems which are 2.for saving the data of the game(not long to see it) and 3.saving the big data of the game(a little difficult,so maye a long time)

#### But you would better not use it for saving the data of the game, because it is not a good way to save the data of the game. You can use it for saving the settings of the game, such as audio, graphics, etc.

#### if you have some examples can add in it please add it.

A flexible settings management system for Unity that handles game settings and saves them to PlayerPrefs. Features include:

- Generic settings management through ScriptableObjects
- Automatic serialization and persistence
- Event-driven architecture
- Support for multiple setting types (Audio, Graphics, etc.)
- Type-safe settings access
- Built-in error handling and validation

#### But you would better not use it for saving the data of the game, because it is not a good way to save the data of the game. You can use it for saving the settings of the game, such as audio, graphics, etc.

### 2. [DialogueSystem][https://github.com/whatevertogo/Unity-DialogueSystem]

A modular, easy-to-understand dialogue system for Unity. The system uses a Control-Controller,InterfaceYouNeed  pattern that makes it highly customizable while remaining simple to use. Features include:

- Linear dialogues
- Branching dialogues with multiple options
- Voice-synchronized dialogues
- Easy prefab creation for dialogue sequences
- you can build a your Dialogue Ways for you own situation

### 3. [UI System for UGUI](LearnAndDoPls/Systems/UI-System-for-UGUI/README.EN.md)

A clean, structured UI management system built for Unity's UGUI. Features include:

- View-based UI architecture
- UI layer management
- Easy view transitions
- View lifecycle management

These codes are written by [@Yuan-Zzzz](https://github.com/Yuan-Zzzz) from the original [UI-System-for-UGUI](https://github.com/Yuan-Zzzz/UI-System-for-UGUI) project and i fix some bugs. I added some comments and made it more readable.


### 4.[HexGridSystem][https://github.com/whatevertogo/HexGridSystem]

This project is a hexagonal grid system that can be used to create hexagonal maps in the Unity game engine. It provides a set of C# scripts, including HexCell, HexCoordinates, HexGrid, HexGridHighlight, HexMesh, and HexMetrics, which help developers quickly build hexagonal grid maps.

Key Features
HexCell: Defines the basic properties and behaviors of hexagonal grid cells
HexCoordinates: Implements a cubic coordinate system for easy positioning and calculation of hexagonal grids
HexGrid: Manages the creation, layout, and updating of hexagonal grids
HexGridHighlight: Provides highlighting and selection functionality for grid cells
HexMesh: Dynamically generates mesh models for hexagonal grids with customizable appearances
HexMetrics: Defines hexagonal geometric parameters and constants to ensure grid consistency

###5.[Timer](https://github.com/whatevertogo/Timer)

- An easy to use Timer


## [Utils](LearnAndDoPls/Utils/README.EN_Utils.md)

A comprehensive collection of utility functions and helper classes:

#### Object Pooling System
- Efficient object reuse system
- Automatic pool expansion
- Memory management optimization
- Perfect for frequently spawned objects:
  - Projectiles
  - Particle effects
  - Enemies
  - Collectables

#### Core Utilities
- Singleton implementations
- Extension methods
- Common helper functions
- Math utilities
- File operations helpers

## [Utility Skills](LearnAndDoPls/SomeSkills/README.EN_SomeSkills.md)

A collection of practical C# implementation examples:

- EventManager - A simple event system for communication between components
- GameInput - Input handling utilities
- PlayerController - Basic player movement and control
- TriggerObject - Easily handle trigger-based interactions

## [Art](Art/README.EN_Art.md)

Visual enhancement tools and shaders:

- Custom shader collection
- Material utilities
- Rendering optimization tools
- Asset management system

## Performance Considerations



### Memory Management

- Use object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
- Implement proper cleanup in OnDisable/OnDestroy
- Avoid allocations during gameplay
- Cache component references

### CPU Optimization

- Use coroutines for time-delayed operations
- Implement efficient update patterns
- Utilize job system for heavy computations
- Profile and optimize bottlenecks

### Best Practices

1. Component Organization
   - Keep components focused and single-purpose
   - Use proper separation of concerns
   - Implement interfaces for better abstraction

2. Code Structure
   - Follow Unity's execution order
   - Use ScriptableObjects for configuration
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Write clear, documented code

3. Scene Management
   - Organize hierarchies efficiently
   - Use prefabs consistently
   - Implement proper scene loading patterns


## How to Use

1. Simply copy the System-folders you need into your Unity project
2. Check the individual README files in each system folder for detailed usage instructions
3. Follow the conventions to organize and manage project assets

## Contribution

@whatevertogo I welcome anyone to point out the shortcomings of my code to help me improve.

Happy Coding!
